    <h2>Life is Made Up of Moments</h2>
    <p class="lead">We know of the joy that comes to our hearts when we reminisce those good, golden times we've had. Our goal is simple and straightforward everytime we're out: <strong>Seize the moment.</strong> Hence, the inspiration for the name of our small, but professional team of  photographers, videographers, and make-up artists. We are very much mindful of the important stories and great events in our client's lives, and we are certain we can turn photographs into paragraphs, and it will be as if looking through your album will feel more like reading a novel. A novel about you.</p>
